**k0rdent** is focused on developing a consistent way to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters at scale. One way to think of k0rdent is as a "super control plane" designed to manage other Kubernetes control planes. Another way to think of k0rdent is as a platform for Platform Engineering.

If you are building an internal developer platform (IDP), need a way to manage Kubernetes clusters at scale in a centralized place, create Golden Paths, etc., k0rdent is a great way to do that.

## What is k0rdent?

Whether you want to manage Kubernetes clusters on-premises, in the cloud, or a combination of both, k0rdent provides a consistent way to do so. With full life-cycle management, including provisioning, configuration, and maintenance, k0rdent is designed to be a repeatable and secure way to manage your Kubernetes clusters in a central location.
